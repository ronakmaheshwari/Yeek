# YEEK: A Yik Yak Clone

**YEEK** is a Yik Yak-like social media platform built for the PC, allowing users to post anonymously, upvote/downvote content, and comment on posts based on their geolocation. The project uses React on the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and Socket.io for real-time updates.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the components and application layout.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for building the API.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication for instant updates.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database to store posts, comments, and votes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (version 12.x or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronakmaheshwari/YEEK.git
    cd YEEK
    ```

2. **Install server dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install client dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL database**:
    - Create a PostgreSQL database called `yeek_db`.
    - Update the `server/config.js` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        db: {
            user: 'your_username',
            host: 'localhost',
            database: 'yeek_db',
            password: 'your_password',
            port: 5432
        }
    };
    ```

5. **Run database migrations**:
    - (Optional) If you have migration scripts, run them to set up tables.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the PostgreSQL server**:
    ```bash
    sudo service postgresql start
    ```

2. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

3. **Run the client**:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
